#This project is a part of my Coursework at Islington College.

Project Highlights:

➥Home Page: The website's landing page was meticulously designed to make a lasting impression on visitors. It serves as an inviting gateway to the world of literature, enticing users to explore further.

➥Product Catalog: The heart of the website is the product page, where an extensive range of books is elegantly listed. 

➥Informative Blog: To foster a reading community and share literary insights, I integrated a blog section. 

➥Research Insights: The research page of the website provides a unique insight into the inspiration behind the website design.

➥Contact and Interaction: A user-friendly contact page enables visitors to get in touch with VitalBooks effortlessly. Whether it's inquiries, feedback, or orders, the website ensures a smooth interaction process.

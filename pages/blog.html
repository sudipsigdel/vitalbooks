        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
          The application of the information and scientific knowledge for the
          development of devices and equipment that can be used in various
          aspect is known as technology. We live in the era of technology.
          Technology enables people to use several things even without having
          detailed knowledge of their working mechanisms. The rapid development
          of computing power and phenomenal expansion of scientific research has
          brought many innovations and significant growth of technology.
          Technology has improved our living standard from last few decades and
          now it becomes hard to imagine our life without technology. In today’s
          world, technology is used in almost every sector. From our home to
          office and even to the scientific task, technology is present there
          for our convenience.
        </p>

        <h1>Positive and negative impact of technology</h1>

        <p>
          With the increase in use of technology, there seems to have both the
          positive as well as negative impact of technology. As known that every
          things have pros and cons, technology also have good aspects but the
          fact that there are negative aspects of technology can’t be denied.
          Some positive as well as negative impacts of technology are described
          below.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Technology has made a lot of positive impact in various sectors.
          Technology has affected the lives of the people in the field of
          communication, education, medical, transportation and so on. It is the
          technology because of which we are able to use mobiles phones. It is
          hard to imagine a day without these mobile phones, email, internet and
          these technological stuffs. The concept of E-learning has been evolved
          because of the technology. People are able to take various classes
          from all over the world through the virtual medium. Likewise,
          technology has brought the revolutionary changes in the medical
          sectors too. Many modern equipment has been developed that seems to be
          very useful for curing the diseases. The medicine of fatal diseases
          has been invented all because of the technology. In the current
          scenario, the vaccine of COVID-19 has been invented all because of
          technology. It seems complicated few decades ago before the evolution
          of technology. Also, transportation sector is widely developed because
          of technology. Bullet train, jet planes, super yacht are the few
          examples of revolutionary products developed with the help of
          technology. Technology has made our life easier in many of these
          aspects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Despite of having all these positive impacts of technology,
          technological experts are worried about the rapid transformation in
          human attention because many of us were unaware about the impacts and
          negative effects that it has brought to people and society in general.
          Modern technology has changed the way people interact nowadays. Though
          technology has made people closer in virtual medium but it creates
          social distance in real life. As a result, people are becoming
          confined to their homes, and do not want to interact with the outside
          world. Privacy has also become the major issue these days. All of our
          data and information are being tracked and recorded. With the increase
          in use of technology, our personal information is stored in the
          internet and it is a subject to risk.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>
          Technology is the result of human inventiveness. Technology has impact
          on almost everybody that has access to them and it has changed the
          society and the way of our living. Undoubtedly technology have
          positive impact on our lives as it really made people life simple and
          easier but still, we have to be careful while using them because we
          may also suffer some negative impacts. Technology is either inherently
          good or bad; it is how we use it that makes it so. The splitting of a
          hydrogen atom is technology at work. As history has shown us,
          technology can equally be used to make a nuclear bomb that kills
          millions - or generate electricity that lights up a million homes.
          It’s up to us how we use the technology.
